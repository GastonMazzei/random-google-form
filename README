This is the code for a GoogleForm that:

 . Has static questions

 . Has a GoogleSpreadsheet to where it 
   writes the answers

. Has videos associated with each question,
  and the videos themselves are randomly 
  changing every N minutes. 
  (currently N = 1 minute)


The constraints are:

 . It must be run in Google.Scripts and 
   that will require setting up an App
   token

Others:

 . Does someone require specific help for reversioning it;
   instead of videos randomize for example images or the 
   questions themselves? Contact me
