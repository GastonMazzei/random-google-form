This is the code for a GoogleForm that:

 . Has static questions

 . Has randomly changing videos every
   N minutes (currently N=1,5,30mins or 
   by the hour or daily are the options)

 . Has a GoogleSpreadsheet to where it 
   writes the answers

The constraints are:

 . It must be run in Google.Scripts and 
   that will require setting up an App
   token

Coming next:

 . Generalization to other random-events
   and a tutorial?
